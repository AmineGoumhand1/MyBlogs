Hello, as a continuaton on our walkthrough about malwares techniques, Today we will cover the Process Hollowing technique.
During this blog, we'll follow this plan :

- **What is Process Hollowing ?**
- **How Process Hollowing works ?**
- **Process Hollowing Implementation**

So let's begin

## What is Process Hollowing

First, we need to clarify the term "Hollowing", "Hollowed out" in the context of process hollowing refers to the act of removing or unmapping the legitimate code from a process's memory space and replacing it with malicious code.

So we can say that Process hollowing is a technique used to inject malicious code into a legitimate process. The process is essentially "hollowed out" and replaced with malicious code, which then runs under the guise of the legitimate process. Guess what, This technique is often used to evade detection by security software because the malicious code is running within a process that appears legitimate. Interesting huh ?

## How Process Hollowing works ?

The Process Hollowing operates on six important steps which are :

- **Create a Suspended Process**

First, we create a new instance of a legitimate process (e.g., notepad.exe) in a suspended state using CreateProcess with the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag. This means the process is created but not yet executed.

- **Unmap the Process's Memory**

Then, we use ZwUnmapViewOfSection or a similar API call to unmap the memory of the main executable image of the suspended process. This effectively "hollows out" the process.

- **Allocate Memory in the Process**
    
Allocates memory within the hollowed-out process using VirtualAllocEx.

- **Write Malicious Code to the Process**

We write the malicious code or the new executable image into the allocated memory of the suspended process using WriteProcessMemory.

- **Set Entry Point**
    
We modifie the entry point of the suspended process to point to the malicious code. This can be done by modifying the PEB (Process Environment Block) structure or by changing the CONTEXT of the process.

- **Resume the Process**
    
Finally, we need to resume the suspended process using ResumeThread. The process starts executing the malicious code instead of the original legitimate code.
