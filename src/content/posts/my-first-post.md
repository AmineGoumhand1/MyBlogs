Hello people, In this series of blogs, I will introduce you to malwares dev and some known techniques that will let you familiarized with maldev, So welcome to you Whatever your level is, a beginner or an advanced dude.

Note : I will stop at each new term to explain it.

### Introduction

Lets take a definition, Malware development involves the creation of malicious software designed to infiltrate, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks. It encompasses the process of designing, coding, testing, and deploying software with malicious intent. This blog explores the intricate world of malware development, shedding light on its methods, motivations, and practical implementations.

So lets define a work plan for our journey.

## Phase 1: Malware Injection Techniques

### Process Injection

You will be able to understand how to inject malicious code into legitimate processes to evade detection and execute malicious actions.

In this category, I'll cover the following techniques :

  - **DLL Injection** 
  - **Process Hollowing**
  - **PE Injection**
  - **Thread Execution Hijacking**
  - **APC Injection**
  - **TLS Injection**
  - **Process Doppelg√§nging**
  - **Process Hollowing**
  - **VDSO Hijacking**
  - **Window Injection**
  - **Reflective DLL Injection**

## Phase 2: Malware Persistence Techniques

I think i'll be able to cover some of persistence techniques like modifying registry keys to ensure the malware executes each time the system boots or a user logs in. 

I will write about the following :

- **BITSjobs** 
- **Browser Extensions**
- **Compromise Host Software Binary**
- **Implant Internal Image**
- **Power Settings**

## Phase 3: Malware Evasion Techniques

Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware.

We'll see some techniques such as :

- **Access Token Manipulation**
- **Debugger Evasion**
- **Deobfuscate/Decode**
- **File and Directory Permissions Modification**
- **Artifacts Hidding**

### Ethical Considerations

Dont give me troubles as a return please, understanding malware development techniques is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to defend against attacks. However, this knowledge should be used responsibly and ethically to protect systems and data.


Stay tuned for the next installment where we dive into practical examples and case studies of malware development techniques.
